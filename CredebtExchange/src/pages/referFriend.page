        <h1>Refer a Friend Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

<p>Currently, Convertibill® is only available to companies registered on the island of Ireland. Users of the Refer a Friend promotional offer can be resident anywhere (hereinafter referred to as the "Introducer"). The Refer a Friend promotion cannot be combined with any other promotion or marketing offer from Credebt Exchange®.

All Refer a Friend form submissions are time stamped and no other methods of submission are acceptable.</p>
<p>The Refer a Friend promotion is monitored on a 'first come, first served' basis. If one or more Introducers refer the same customer to Credebt Exchange®, the Introducer that submitted the first time stamped Refer a Friend form is the only person that will be paid the EUR 500.
